# SE(3) Equivariant GNN

Forked NVIDIA's code for SE(3) Equivariant GNN to modify it for molecular property (specific protein binding affinity) prediction on a custom dataset for the [NeurIPS 2024 Leash Bio Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leash-BELKA). My code and modifications are in the [leash-bio](https://github.com/ndriggs/DeepLearningExamples/tree/leash-bio) branch.
